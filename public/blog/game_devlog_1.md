# Game Devlog #1

#### Jan. 28, 2021 | Gavin Rossiter

Welcome to my premiere of my devlog series! 
Each devlog will include a short video and some text describing what I have done since last time.
They will be mostly for me so they will be pretty boring, at least at the start.
I hope that I'll eventually take the plunge and start recording voice over to make proper devlog videos.
[Miziziziz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9EM2S_0rvU) was kind enough to give me some helpful advice on this topic today,
but it'll be a while before I'm ready for that.

I spent this past weekend working on the basics for my game project in Unity.
This work included a character controller, a dummy 3d character with basic locomotion animations and some terrain.

The character controller behaves similar to other action adventure games like legend of zelda BOTW.
You can freelook with the mouse and move relative to the camera with WASD.
I created it from scratch since most other solutions are either super bloated with bells and whistles or didn't suit the style I wanted.

The character and animations were downloaded from mixamo.com and imported into Unity with zero hassle.
Its truly incredible to me that these kinds of assets at the quality provided are free for anyone to use.
I followed a few of [Nicky's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9uqO0ei_zOHotEWfEj72mw) tutorials for this, they really help dumb it right down for me and explained everything very clearly.

The terrain was created using Map Magic 2, a free asset from the Unity store by [Denis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-mZzMZiGW9L00RgztziFIA).  It's an incredibly powerful piece of software and really makes me wonder about the potential of graph based programming languages.  I am however, not looking forward to integrating 3rd party packages like this into my solution to achieve the level design I'm after.  

Lots of learning ahead.
