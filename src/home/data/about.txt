#> about

Hey I'm Gav.

TLDR for recruiters;
"In my next role I want to build an AI system in a team focussed on lean delivery."

At work I'm a systems software engineer working in air traffic management.
I'm part of a team of 30, responsible for delivering the controller facing applications.
At home you will find me working on some personal projects, learning all that I can about AI or updating my website gavinrossiter.dev.
I have an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for creating value for society.
On the technical side I have a strong mathematics background and a keen interest in AI and machine learning.
