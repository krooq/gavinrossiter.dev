Hey I'm Gav.

TLDR for recruiters;
"In my next role I want to build an AI system in an agile *get it done* team."

I'm a software engineer with a strong mathematics background and a keen interest in AI and machine learning. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for creating value.

At work I'm a systems software engineer working in air traffic management. In this role I've worked in a large software team, liased with stakeholders from across the seas and built a java CSCI from scratch.
So lots of experience in the engineering product lifecycle.

At home you will find me working on my personal projects, learning all that I can about AI or updating my website https: //gavinrossiter.dev
