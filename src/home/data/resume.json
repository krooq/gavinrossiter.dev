    "about": "Hi I'm Gav,\n\nTo date, I have spent most of my career as a systems software engineer working in air traffic management. I'm part of a team of 30, responsible for delivering the controller facing applications for a next gen air traffic system. At home I spend almost every waking hour working on personal projects, updating my website or learning all that I can about AI. \n\nI'm particularly interested in AI and the relationship humans form with it. Artificial intelligence is significantly disrupting the way we live our lives, and the rate of improvement is only increasing. To that effect, it is my goal to help humanity build a safe and symbiotic relationship with artificial intelligence so we may enjoy the benefits and avoid the disasters.\n\nIn my next role I want to take a leap into the field of AI/ML.  I have strong software and mathematics skills and an unbridled passion for the field.  I also have an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for creating value for society. If you are looking for someone with these traits to fill a role in the AI/ML field please reach out.",
    "motivation": "It is my goal to help humanity build a safe and symbiotic relationship with a future artificial general intelligence.\nSo that ultimately humanity can enjoy the freedoms of a post scarcity economy awarded by such technologies. I also like to keep the lights on, so at my day job I help make the skies safer by building the next generation of air traffic management systems.",
