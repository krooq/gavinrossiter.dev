    "about": "Hi I'm Gav. At work I'm a systems software engineer working in air traffic management. I'm part of a team of 30, responsible for delivering the controller facing applications for a next gen air traffic system. At home you will find me working on some personal projects, learning all that I can about AI or updating my website. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for creating value for society. On the technical side I have a strong mathematics background and a deep interest in AI and machine learning.",
    "motivation": "It is my goal to help humanity build a safe and symbiotic relationship with a future artificial general intelligence.\nSo that ultimately humanity can enjoy the freedoms of a post scarcity economy awarded by such technologies. I also like to keep the lights on, so at my day job I help make the skies safer by building the next generation of air traffic management systems.",
